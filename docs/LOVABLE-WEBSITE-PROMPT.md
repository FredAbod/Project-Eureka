## 📝 Additional Notes for Lovable

### If Lovable asks for more details:

**For 3D Credit Cards:**
"Create 3-5 credit cards floating in 3D space. Cards should have realistic materials (metallic, glossy), subtle reflections, and shadows. They should rotate slowly and tilt based on mouse position. Add bank logos on the cards (GTBank, Access, Zenith, UBA, First Bank)."

**For Particles:**
"Create a particle system with 1000+ small dots/spheres that form connections between them (like a neural network). Particles should be white/cyan with opacity. Some connections should pulse with light traveling along them."

**For Glass Morphism:**
"Cards should have: backdrop-filter: blur(20px), background: rgba(255,255,255,0.05), border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1), with subtle shadows."

**For Performance:**
"Use React.memo for expensive 3D components, lazy load sections below fold, use requestAnimationFrame for animations, compress all assets."

---

## 🎯 After Lovable Generates the Site

1. **Deploy immediately to Vercel** (Lovable can do this)
2. **Get the URL** (e.g., `eureka-ng.vercel.app`)
3. **Use that URL for Mono registration** ✅ (This is your immediate goal!)
4. **Set up Supabase** (if Lovable hasn't auto-configured it)
5. **Test the waitlist form** (ensure data is being saved)
6. **Optional: Buy custom domain** (`eureka.ng` or `geteureka.ng`)
7. **Add Google Analytics** to track visitors
8. **Share with stakeholders** to show progress

## 🔗 Mono Integration Details (For Future Backend)

Once you have your website live and complete Mono registration, here's how to integrate:

**Your Mono Credentials (Sandbox):**
- Public Key: `test_pk_ylrr82nphrx7naa9rl54`
- Secret Key: `test_sk_a2zqdca3bu0x44umfqxx`
- Environment: Sandbox (for testing)

**Integration Flow (Will be implemented in main backend later):**

1. **Frontend (Website):** User connects bank via Mono Widget
   ```javascript
   const config = {
     key: "test_pk_ylrr82nphrx7naa9rl54", // Your public key
     data: { 
       customer: {
         name: user.name,
         email: user.email
       }
     },
     onSuccess: (data) => {
       // Send auth code to your backend
       sendToBackend(data.code);
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Backend (Main App):** Exchange code for account ID
   ```bash
   curl --request POST \
     --url https://api.withmono.com/v2/accounts/auth \
     --header 'mono-sec-key: test_sk_a2zqdca3bu0x44umfqxx' \
     --data '{"code":"AUTH_CODE_FROM_FRONTEND"}'
   ```

3. **Backend (Main App):** Fetch account data
   ```bash
   curl --request GET \
     --url https://api.withmono.com/v2/accounts/{account_id}/transactions \
     --header 'mono-sec-key: test_sk_a2zqdca3bu0x44umfqxx'
   ```

**NOTE:** The marketing website doesn't need Mono integration yet. That will be implemented in your main WhatsApp banking backend (`c:\Users\user\Desktop\apps\whatsappAi\src`).

The website just needs to:
- Look professional ✅
- Collect waitlist signups ✅
- Provide your Mono registration URL ✅

---

## 💡 Pro Tips for Working with Lovable

1. **Start simple, iterate:** If Lovable struggles with complex 3D, start with basic version and ask it to "add 3D effects to the hero section"

2. **Use Spline embeds:** Tell Lovable: "Instead of coding Three.js from scratch, embed Spline scenes" (easier and faster)

3. **Reference examples:** Say "Make it look like [specific website URL] but for Nigerian banking"

4. **Break it down:** If it generates errors, ask it to "Create just the hero section first with 3D animations"

5. **Mobile-first:** Remind it: "Make sure this works perfectly on mobile phones"

---

## 🎨 Quick Alternative (If Time-Constrained)

If you need something faster for Mono registration today:

```
Create a simple, professional one-page site for "Project Eureka":
- Hero with logo and tagline: "Nigeria's AI-Powered Multi-Bank Platform"
- Brief description (3 sentences)
- "Coming Soon - Join Waitlist" button
- Footer with email contact

Use: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, dark mode, subtle animations.
Deploy to Vercel immediately.
```

Then enhance with 3D animations later.

---

**Remember:** The 3D animations are what will make this site stand out and look like a modern, serious fintech company. Don't skip the 3D elements - they're your competitive advantage for making a strong visual impression! 🚀
