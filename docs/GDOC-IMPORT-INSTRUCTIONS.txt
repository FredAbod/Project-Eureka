Google Docs Import / Copy-Paste Instructions

Option A — Quick copy/paste
1. Open `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW-GDOC.md` in your editor.
2. Select all and copy.
3. In Google Docs, create a new document and paste — Google Docs will retain headings and bullets.

Option B — Import HTML (preserves formatting)
1. Open Google Docs → File → Open → Upload
2. Choose `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW-GDOC.html` and upload.
3. Google Docs will convert the HTML into a doc with headings and lists.

Option C — Upload plain text
1. Open Google Docs → File → Open → Upload
2. Choose `docs/PROJECT-OVERVIEW.txt` and upload.
3. Reformat as needed.

Notes
- The Markdown file is the most editable and quick to copy; the HTML import preserves exact layout.
- If you want a Google Drive file created programmatically, provide a Drive API token and I can generate the document for you (requires OAuth/permissions).

Done — pick the option that fits your workflow.
